## Features

* **Gimbal-less Design:** Utilizes an MPU-6050 IMU for pitch and roll sensing, reducing mechanical complexity and size.
* **Arduino Pro Micro Based:** Easy to program and widely supported.
* **Custom PCB Shield:** Simplifies wiring and assembly for a cleaner build.
* **Configurable Controls:** Supports a thrust/rudder potentiometer, 5-way HAT switch, and multiple tactile buttons.
* **EEPROM Storage:** Saves calibration and configuration settings for persistence across power cycles.
* **USB HID Joystick:** Recognized as a standard joystick by your operating system, no special drivers needed.

## Hardware

The core of this project is a custom 3D-printed enclosure (design files not included in this repo, but mentioned for context) housing the electronics.

### PCB Shield (Gerber Files)

The `Yoke_Pro_Micro_-_new.zip` archive contains all the necessary manufacturing files for the custom PCB shield. This shield is designed to sit on top of the Arduino Pro Micro, simplifying the connections for the MPU-6050, potentiometer, and buttons.

**To order the PCB:**
1.  Download and extract the `Yoke_Pro_Micro_-_new.zip` file.
2.  Upload the contents of the extracted folder (the `.gbr` files) to your preferred PCB fabrication service (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park).
3.  Ensure you select appropriate manufacturing parameters (e.g., 2-layer board, FR-4 material).

The PCB is designed with footprints for:
* Arduino Pro Micro (via pin headers)
* MPU-6050 module (I2C connection)
* Pin headers for connecting the potentiometer and tactile buttons.

## Firmware

The `Pro_Micro_Joystick_v2_8` folder contains the Arduino Sketch (firmware) for the gimbal-less flightstick.

### Compatibility

This firmware is designed specifically for the **Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32U4)**. It leverages the native USB capabilities of this microcontroller to act as a HID (Human Interface Device) joystick.

### Dependencies

Before compiling, you need to install the following libraries in your Arduino IDE:

1.  **`Joystick.h`**: This library is usually included with the Arduino IDE for ATmega32U4 boards, but ensure it's available. It handles the USB HID joystick communication.
2.  **`Wire.h`**: Standard Arduino library for I2C communication (required for MPU-6050).
3.  **`Adafruit_ADS1015.h`**: Required if you use an external ADC for higher precision inputs. If your design relies solely on the Pro Micro's internal ADC, this might be optional or removed.
    * *Installation:* Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...` and search for "Adafruit ADS1015".
4.  **`EEPROM.h`**: Standard Arduino library for reading and writing to the EEPROM (for configuration storage).
5.  **`MPU6050_light.h`** (or similar MPU-6050 library): A library to easily interface with the MPU-6050.
    * *Installation:* Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...` and search for "MPU6050_light" or your preferred MPU6050 library.

### Configuration

Open the `Pro_Micro_Joystick_v2_8.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

* **`FIRMWARE_VERSION`**: Defined on line 15, indicates the firmware version.
* **`JoystickConfig` Struct**: (Lines 18-22) Defines the structure for configuration data stored in EEPROM, including version, lean angle, handedness, and Kalman filter level.
* **Pin Definitions**: (Lines 31-41) Crucially, these lines define which physical pins on the Arduino Pro Micro are connected to your joystick's components. **Adjust these values to match your PCB and wiring if you deviate from the original design.**
    * `THRUST_UP_PIN`, `THRUST_DOWN_PIN`: For the thrust/rudder potentiometer.
    * `COOLIE_UP_PIN`, `COOLIE_DOWN_PIN`, `COOLIE_LEFT_PIN`, `COOLIE_RIGHT_PIN`, `COOLIE_PRESS_PIN`: For the 5-way navigation switch.
    * `SET_BUTTON_PIN`: A special button for entering configuration/calibration modes.
    * `RST_BUTTON_PIN`: Reset button (often tied to the Pro Micro's reset).
    * `BUTTON_1_PIN`, `BUTTON_2_PIN`, `BUTTON_3_PIN`, `BUTTON_4_PIN`: General-purpose buttons.

### Uploading the Firmware

1.  Connect your Arduino Pro Micro to your computer using a Micro USB cable.
2.  Open the `Pro_Micro_Joystick_v2_8.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3.  Go to `Tools > Board` and select `Arduino Leonardo` (the Pro Micro uses the same ATmega32U4 chip).
4.  Go to `Tools > Port` and select the serial port corresponding to your Pro Micro.
5.  Click the "Upload" button (right arrow icon).

Once uploaded, your Pro Micro should be recognized by your operating system as a standard USB joystick.

## Assembly

Detailed assembly instructions are outside the scope of this README, as they depend heavily on the 3D-printed enclosure design (not provided here). However, the general steps involve:

1.  **Solder components to the PCB shield:** Install the MPU-6050, pin headers for the Arduino Pro Micro, and other connection pins.
2.  **Mount the Arduino Pro Micro:** Plug the Pro Micro onto the soldered pin headers of the PCB shield.
3.  **Wire external components:** Connect the potentiometer, 5-way switch, and tactile buttons to the appropriate pins on the PCB shield using jumper wires.
4.  **Enclosure:** Integrate the assembled electronics into your 3D-printed flightstick handle.
